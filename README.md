# Pre-label for object detection using pre-trained deeplearning model

- Script to pre-label: Using a deeplearning model to create a label for some object classes. Label has YOLO format  
- Then using script to convert YOLO format to labelme format which labelme can read
- Using labelme to check by human
- Finally convert labelme format to any other format. currently support YOLO
